UI Summary:

Provide a button to save the current tabs in the current window. User must provide a name for this set of tabs. Ex: "Work" or "Kayaking"

Also list out currently stored tab sets. For a currently stored tab set, you can either restore it (which will open a new window with all of the tabs), or delete it. Deletion should require a confirmation so as to prevent accidents.

Delete can be a trash can icon. Restore can just be "Restore" text, for clarity. Use a "+" icon for creating a new set. Save and restore should be different sections. There should be a save button.
